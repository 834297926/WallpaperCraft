## About

WallpaperCraft adds hundreds of new building blocks in a vast range of colors, integrating classic building blocks like clay, wood, glass and bricks.

The 1.7.10 and 1.10.2 versions are authored and released by AaronMC.

The 1.14.4, 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.16.1, and 1.16.2 versions are authored and released by Ommina.

The 1.14.4 version, and subsequent updates, are a complete rewrite, using no code from the earlier versions.  It does, however, reuse oliviaoliviasson's original textures and item/block names.

## Downloads

* 1.7.10 and 1.10.2 versions have been removed from CurseForge, presumably by the author.
