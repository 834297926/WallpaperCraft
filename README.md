## About

WallpaperCraft adds hundreds of new building blocks in a vast range of colors, integrating classic building blocks like clay, wood, glass and bricks.

The 1.7.10 and 1.10.2 version are authored and released by AaronMC.
The 1.14.2 version is authored and released by Ommina.

The 1.14.2 version is a complete rewrite, using no code from the earlier versions.  It does, however, reuse AaronMC's original textures.
