1.0.4  2019-09-13

FIX: Update to play nicely with Forge 28.1 (the "requires language provider javafml:28 we have found 28.1" error)


1.0.3  2019-08-16

FIX: JEI not showing the "base block + patterns" recipe, making finding the starting block itself very difficult indeed.  (Thanks FraukeS for the issue report.)

ADD: Wool Press recipe

CHANGED: Patterned Wool Press recipe
